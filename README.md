The source code for the 2D virtual reality software **FlyoVeR** is available [here](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/FlyoVeR).

 
#### Contents of this repo:
*  Data: This directory contains raw virtual trajectory data collected with FlyoVeR, images of the respective flies (mounts), and the scene files used for the experiments. Data is organized according to the type of experiment, roughtly matching the flow of the figures in the associated paper.
*  Code: Python (2.7) code used to process the virtual trajectory data. The notebook subdirectory contains ipython notebooks, the other directories contain different analysis modules.
